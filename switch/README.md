# SwitchesÂ ðŸŽ› #

This entire folder is included into the ["switch"-integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/switch.template/). Each file is briefly described here. But at first here is a short list, which switch-platforms I'm using:

- **[template](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/switch.template/)** - used (atm) only to integrate unsupported hardware to [HomeKit](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/homekit/).
- **[circadian_lighting](https://github.com/claytonjn/hass-circadian_lighting)** - every light group gets its own switch. Used to dis- /enable the color adjustment.
- **[wake_on_lan](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wake_on_lan/)** - used to wake up corresponding devices from sleep

At the moment, I'm not using that much switches...

## homekit_switches.yaml ##

Some integrations, as my vaccuum robot, are not supported by [HomeKit](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/homekit/). But because of the easy access with Siri I want them still there. Thats why im adding a custom switch that starts the vaccuum robot and calls him back.

## circadian_lighting.yaml ##

All [circadian_lighting-switches](https://github.com/claytonjn/hass-circadian_lighting) used in my Smart Home. For a more detailed explanation look [here](https://github.com/claytonjn/hass-circadian_lighting).

## **wake_on_lan.yaml** ##

As the name says, here are all my [wake_on_lan](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wake_on_lan/) switches. At the moment I'm only treat my Living Room PC at the moment.
